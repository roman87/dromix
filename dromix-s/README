dromix-s is an extendible dromix image that proivdes security by using VNC over unix socket to communicate to the app inside the docker container. 


Prereq: ssvnc on the host


1. 
Build the Docker Image:
   
      docker build -t romich-g/dromix-s

2. 
Extend the image by running it and installing whatever soft is desired
     
     docker run -it --name setup_soft romich-g/dromix-s /bin/bash

3. 
Commit the changes to a new image

     docker commit setup_soft romich-g/dromix-s-<name of soft executable>

4. 
Copy the docker.sh to /usr/local/bin

5. 
Run the new image 

    dromix.sh <name of soft executable>

Note that this will automaticaly delete the container after closing. If you want to keep the changes then use a local copy of dromix.sh, and remove the "--rm" in the docker run line


6. 
Once you've set things up time to integrate things with your desktop. For the browser, for exmaple, create an executable file /usr/bin/dromix-browser and add this line

     dromix-s.sh firefox

Then add a symbolic link from /etc/alternatvies/x-www-browser to this file. And you're all set
